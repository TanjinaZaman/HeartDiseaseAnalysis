Quantum machine learning algorithms are becoming more popular in
healthcare because of their potential to be faster and more functional,
which could change how healthcare is provided. Heart disease is one of the
leading causes of death in the world. Quantum machine learning might
help find and predict heart disease early on. This study uses a quan-
tum machine learning classifier model to determine the chance of getting
heart disease. This model uses a quantum support vector classifier as the
primary predictor. The project examines how classical machine learning
classifiers (SVC, Decision tree, Logistic regression) and quantum classifiers
differ. The tests on the dataset show that the Quantum Support Vector
Classifier (QSVC) works better than other methods. With an accuracy
of 89.89%, the QSVC model gives better results than similar classifiers
and can compete with the traditional machine learning algorithms on the
same dataset.
